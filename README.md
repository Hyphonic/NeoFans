## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hyphonic/NeoFans.git
cd NeoFans
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To allow GitHub Actions to run the workflow, you need to add the following secrets to your repository:

- `COOMER_SESS`: [Coomer Session Cookie](https://coomer.su/)
- `KEMONO_SESS`: [Kemono Session Cookie](https://kemono.su/)

I mainly use these websites to fetch the favorites of the creators. If you don't want to use this program on GitHub Actions, you can either import the session token as an environment variable or change the code to use your session token depending on the platform. (<- Offline use only)

> [!NOTE]
> Since version 2.1.0, NeoFans uses the Rich library for console output.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
python Main.py
```

> This repository comes with a workflow that is readily available for use. Keep in mind that some visual errors may occur since GitHub Actions doesnt allow for line refreshing programs such as the rich progress bars.

## üìö Config Usage

NeoFans uses a built-in config system that allows you to customize the behavior of the program.
